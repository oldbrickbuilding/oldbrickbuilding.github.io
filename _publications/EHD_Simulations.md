title: "(In Progress) Simulations to model and predict the deposition behavior of electrohydrodynamic manufacturing processes"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/EHD_Simulations
excerpt: 'Electrospinning has been modeled using a Langrangian, as well as an Eularian
approach. Depending on which model is employed, various features of the
electrospinning process may be analytically or numerically studied, e.g., when
analyzing fiber diameter as a function of jet instability and whipping. Numerically,
Reneker et al. proposed a discrete model, which divides the jet into $$N$$ elements, or
beads, each possessing an individual mass $$(m_i)$$ and charge $$(q_i)$$. In this system,
each bead is interconnected by viscoelastic filaments, which can be generalized by a
spring-damper system. Here, a positively charged element, $$m_i$$, among
$$N$$ adjacent charges, is injected from a positively charged nozzle into an external
electric field. In this scenario, the $$i^{th}$$ bead will be accelerated by the
external electric field, $$E_i$$, at each point, which is sometimes approximated by the
voltage on each conductor and/or dielectric within the vicinity of the jet. For a three-
dimensional system, calculating this electric field, $$E_i$$, at each coordinate can be
computationally intensive, especially in consideration of each electrode architecture.
However, there are some numerical methods that may be useful for simulation
purposes, e.g., using a boundary element method. Knowing the electric field at
each point then provides the amount of force on the $$i^{th}$$ bead, where $$q_i$$ is the charge on the $$i^{th}$$ bead and
$$E_i$$ is the electric field at the $$i^{th}$$ coordinate due the surrounding conductors and dielectrics...'

Electrospinning has been modeled using a Langrangian, as well as an Eularian
approach. Depending on which model is employed, various features of the
electrospinning process may be analytically or numerically studied, e.g., when
analyzing fiber diameter as a function of jet instability and whipping. Numerically,
Reneker et al. proposed a discrete model, which divides the jet into $$N$$ elements, or
beads, each possessing an individual mass $$(m_i)$$ and charge $$(q_i)$$. In this system,
each bead is interconnected by viscoelastic filaments, which can be generalized by a
spring and dashpot. Here, a positively charged element, $$m_i$$, among
$$N$$ adjacent charges, is injected from a positively charged nozzle into an external
electric field. In this scenario, it is evident that the ith bead will be accelerated by an
external electric field, $$E_i$$, at each point, which is sometimes approximated by the
voltage on each conductor and/or dielectric within the vicinity of the jet. For a three-
dimensional system, calculating this electric field, $$E_i$$, at each coordinate can be
computationally intensive, especially in consideration of each electrode architecture.
However, there are some numerical methods that may be useful for simulation
purposes, e.g. using a boundary element method. Knowing the electric field at
each point then provides the amount of force on the $$i^{th}$$ bead, where qi is the charge on the $$i^{th}$$ bead and
$$E_i$$ is the electric field at the $$i^{th}$$ coordinate due the surrounding conductors and dielectrics
