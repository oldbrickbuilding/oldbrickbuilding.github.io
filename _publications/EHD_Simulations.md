excerpt: 'Electrospinning has been modeled using a Langrangian as well as an Eularian
approach. Depending on which model is employed, various features of the
electrospinning process may be analytically or numerically studied, e.g., when
analyzing fiber diameter as a function of jet instability and whipping. Numerically,
Reneker et al. proposed a discrete model, which divides the jet into $$N$$ elements, each possessing an individual mass $$(m_i)$$ and charge $$(q_i)$$. In this system,
each mass is interconnected by viscoelastic filaments, which can be generalized by a
spring-mass-damper system. Here, a positively charged element, $$m_i$$, among
$$N-1$$ adjacent charges, is injected from a positively charged nozzle into an external
electric field. In this scenario, the $$i^{th}$$ mass will be accelerated by the
external electric field, $$E_i$$, at each point. For a three-
dimensional system, calculating the electric field, $$E_i$$, at each position can be
computationally intensive, especially in consideration of the architecture of each electrode.
However, there are numerical methods, e.g., boundary element methods...'
