What:  An advanced thermesthesiometer has been developed to measure the heat flux, touch-force, and internal temperature profile of multiple test surfaces under transient conditions.  This instrument is used to characterize various materials for end-use conditions and aims to quantify the potential for thermal hazards in connection with human subjective testing. 
Why:  Materials in industrial environments can dissipate a significant amount of heat.  It is not always possible to theoretically predict this process as many thermal systems are often composed of complex composite shells or housed in materials that vary in surface texture. 
How: A suitably chosen material with thermal characteristics similar to that of human tissue is thermally regulated using a programmable logic controller (PLC). Â An automated driving mechanism provides variable touch-occurrences and pressures over specially engineered test-surfaces; each with varying effusivities and surface texture.
