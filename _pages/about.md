My name is Paul and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am currently developing my skills in model-predictive manufacturing, control systems, and precision instrumentation at the Mechatronics, Automations, and Control Systems (MACS) Laboratory (https://macslab.xyz/). My recent work has focused on model-based methods to predict the behavior of patented electrohydrodynamic manufacturing processes. Please feel free to browse my list of publications for more information and, as always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating!
