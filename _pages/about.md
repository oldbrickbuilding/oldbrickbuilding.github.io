As a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, my academic research is conducted at the Mechatronics, Automation, and Control Systems Laboratory. My most recent work uses experiments paired with numerical modeling to predict the behavior of patented electrohydrodynamic processes. Please feel free to browse my list of publications for more information and, as always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating!
